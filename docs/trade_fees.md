## Trade Fee Guide

Setting trade fees for your items is a great way to generate passive income
for your in-game economy. There are a number of ways you can charge trading fees
briefly summarized below:

### Enjin Transfer Fees

These are simple fees paid in ENJ. The fees are always paid by the SENDER and
the fees go to the CREATOR of the item. Note that if the CREATOR is sending or
receiving items no fees will apply.

PER_TRANSFER - This is a flat fee **per transaction**, payable by SENDER to the
CREATOR in ENJ.

PER_CRYPTO_ITEM - This is a fee **per item** being transferred, payable by SENDER to
the CREATOR in ENJ.

RATIO_CUT - A percentage of items is taken from the total being transferred From
the SENDER and given to the CREATOR.

RATIO_EXTRA - A percentage of items is taken from the seller in addition to the Items
being sold. The percentage of items goes to the creator.
