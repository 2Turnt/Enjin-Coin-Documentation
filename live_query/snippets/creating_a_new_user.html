	<summary>
		A game developer can, using their privileged Admin User, create additional Users for their players.
	</summary>
	<div>
		<p>
			This method, given an Admin's access token, will send a request to the Cloud Platform which creates a new User and Identity with the
			specified details. This Identity will need to be linked at some point to a Player's wallet using the Enjin Wallet App before it can be
			particularly useful. The use case for this sort of User crreation is to let game developers leverage the Cloud Platform as a kind of
			authorization and credentials backend in supporting User login.
		</p>

		<section class='example'>
			<p>
				Creating a new User on the Cloud Platform requires specifying a name, password, unique email, and role. All fields are specified as
				text strings, with the Role matching an existing value known to the Cloud Platform. The User is created under the specified App that
				the caller is an Admin of. The GraphQL query to do so is as follows:
			</p>

			<p>
				Some calls to the Cloud Platform require specifying a particular App to operate on. This is one such call. The App is specified by
				setting a header called:
			<pre>X-App-Id</pre>
			With the value being the App ID you which to use. You can find potential App identifiers as the "app_id" field in the response to the
			"Getting Access Credentials" call.
			</p>

			<p>
				The current App ID being used in this session is: <span class="app-id"></span><br/>
				To switch app please choose another app from the Applications tab above then navigate back here.

			<input class='parameter' type='text' name='password' placeholder='Password'>

				Here is the output response from the Cloud Platform:

				In this example query, we have created a new User on the Cloud Platform. In order for this call to succeed, the caller must have
				permissions to create Users on their App. Typically, this is done by letting the caller have the Admin or Platform Owner Roles. This
				new User is automatically created with a single Identity for the caller's App. The corresponding function in the Unity SDK to this
				GraphQL call is <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#ad3766c8ed4e8fdb68f065177d4046027" target="_blank">CreateUser(string
				username, string email, string password, string role)</a> which will create a new User with new Identity and return it such that we
				might link it to a Player's wallet.
