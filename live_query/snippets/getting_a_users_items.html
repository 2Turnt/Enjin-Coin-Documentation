			This method, given a User's access token, will send a request to the Cloud Platform which returns a User's inventory for a specified
			Identity. An Identity is tied to a single wallet address, and a User can have many of them across different Cloud Platform apps. Users can
			also have a single Identity with items from multiple apps.

				Retrieving a User's inventory from the Cloud Platform requires knowing the ID for an Identity of theirs. The GraphQL query to do so is
				as follows:
			</p>

			<pre><code class="query-display language-graphql">
query getAllItems($identityId: Int!) {
  result: EnjinIdentities(id: $identityId) {
    tokens(include_creator_tokens: true) {
		app_id
		index
		token_id
		name
		creator
		totalSupply
		reserve
		circulatingSupply
		supplyModel
		meltValue
		meltFeeRatio
		meltFeeMaxRatio
		transferable
		transferFeeSettings {
		  type
		  token_id
		  value
		}
		nonFungible
		icon
		isCreator
	}
  }
}
              </code></pre>

			<p>
				Pressing the 'Submit Query' button will POST the query above to the Cloud Platform endpoint, along with additional parameters encoded
				as follows:
			</p>

			<input class='parameter' type='text' name='identityId' placeholder='Identity ID'>

			<pre><code class='parameter-display language-javascript'>
{}
              </code></pre>

			<button class='submit-button'>Submit Query</button>

			<p>
				Here is the output response from the Cloud Platform:
			</p>

			<pre><code class='output-display language-javascript'>
{
}
              </code></pre>

			<p>
				In this example query, we have retrieved the first page of a User's inventory from the Cloud Platform. Please note that the "page"
				parameter may be changed to query for additional items as desired by your game's needs. The corresponding function in the Unity SDK to
				this GraphQL call is <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#a91d65b738b2b58ede69122afb8e83501" target="_blank">Enjin.GetAllItems(int
				identityID)</a> which will return a workable list of all Items tied to an Identity and their relevant metadata.
