        Welcome to the documentation for the Enjin SDK. Here you will find useful instructions for interacting with the tools we provide to make the true ownership of in-game items possible. This page is a customized landing menu to explore general, useful GraphQL queries with links to their equivalent functions in Unity. If you'd like to explore the full automatically-generated Unity documentation, feel free to peruse the included <a href="doxygen/index.html" target="_blank">Doxygen resources</a>.

          About the Cloud Platform
        </header>

        <p>
          The Cloud Platform is Enjin's intermediary server to make interacting with our deployed ERC-1155 smart contract implementation easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cloud Platforms are deployed to specific URLs and listen for POSTed GraphQL queries. In this documentation, the Cloud Platform at the following URL will be queried:
          <br>
          <input id='platform-url' type='text' value='https://kovan.cloud.enjin.io/graphql/'>
        </p>

          Operations Involving Users
        </header>

        <p>
          Users are an abstraction on the Cloud Platform for someone with login details. This encompasses someone who might be a Player, an Admin, or a Platform Owner. Players are Users who do not have any special permissions within a single app. They are normal, unelevated, and the majority of Users. Admins are Users with elevated permissions within a single app, typically the developer. This is a good Role to assign to something like a server which proxies requests on behalf of Players. Platform Owners have elevated privileges across an entire Cloud Platform. A use case for such a Role is an over-arching developer Role which wants to access multiple items from multiple individual apps on that single instance of a Cloud Platform. More generally, Roles are custom collections of permissions that can be created and attached to specific Users in order to restrict some parts of the SDK functionality. The Player, Admin, and Platform Owner permissions described here represent what is available as default Roles.
        </p>

            Getting Access Credentials
          </header>
          <summary>
            Most functionality that this SDK supports, whether querying Player data or requesting operations on CryptoItems, requires an access token to use.
          </summary>
          <details>
            <p>
              This method retrieves an access token given a User's credentials. This access token is used by including it in an 'Authorization' header on the outbound POST request to Enjin's Cloud Platform. The access token serves to identify the User and makes sure that only those with valid permissions can enact Cloud Platform operations. Executing this example will set the access token which is used to validate requests for all other examples on this page.
            </p>

            <section class='example'>
              <p>
                Logging a User into a Cloud Platform requires their email address and password. The GraphQL query to do so is as follows:
              </p>

              <pre><code class='query-display highlight language-graphql'>
query login($email:String!, $password:String!) {
  results: EnjinOauth(email: $email, password: $password) {
    id
    access_tokens
    roles {
      name
    }
    identities {
      id
      app_id
      ethereum_address
    }
  }
}
              </code></pre>

              <p>
                Pressing the 'Submit Query' button will POST the query above to the Cloud Platform endpoint, along with additional parameters encoded as follows:
              </p>

              <input class='parameter' type='text' name='email' placeholder='Email'>
              <br>
              <input class='parameter' type='text' name='password' placeholder='Password'>

              <pre><code class='parameter-display highlight language-javascript'>
{}
              </code></pre>

              <button class='submit-button'>Submit Query</button>

              <p>
                Here is the output response from the Cloud Platform:
              </p>

              <pre><code class='output-display highlight language-javascript'>
{
}
              </code></pre>

              <p>
                In the Unity SDK, functionality identical to this call is implemented by the <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#ab9af06457f065cebd30f28ef5d20cf92" target="_blank">Enjin.Login(string username, string password)</a> method. This method takes the same input of a username and password before returning a User object containing that User's id, access token, an array of Roles, and an array of Identities. In a similar vein, the <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#abd0ebc7f68d479d83a8d365c52d35993" target="_blank">Enjin.VerifyLogin(string username, string password)</a> method performs an identical login query but only returns the User, success state, and does not alter global AppID state. Its purpose is to validate the correct login of a User for game servers which are proxying requests. The SDK also includes <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#accf26efc6912b460998fd39e471e8acb" target="_blank">StartPlatform()</a> methods which initialize the SDK as a whole to a specific Cloud Platform with a specific User to issue requests, which is very useful for signing in with a managing Admin.
