        Here we learn how to send an Item from the caller's wallet to a User.

            This method, given an access token, will send a request to the Cloud Platform which creates a new item transfer request to be either
            accepted or denied in the Enjin Wallet of the access token's owner. This second factor of accepting or denying the transfer request on a
            separate service is a security feature to protect against potentially malicious developers, server proxies, or compromised machines.

                Creating an Item transfer request on the Cloud Platform requires specifying an identifier for the sender's Identity, an identifier for
                the recipient's Identity, the identifier for the Item to transfer, and an amount of that Item to transfer. Once the request appears in
                the sender's wallet and is accepted, the Item is moved from the Ethereum address that is linked to the sending Identity and into the
                Ethereum address that is linked to the recipient's Identity. To do this successfully, the sender requires some Ether to cover gas
                costs. They might also potentially require some Enjin Coin to cover transaction fees specified by the game developer. The GraphQL
                query to do so is as follows:
            </p>

            <p>
                Some calls to the Cloud Platform require specifying a particular App to operate on. This is one such call. The App is specified by
                setting a header called:
            <code>X-App-Id</code>
            With the value being the App ID you which to use. You can find potential App identifiers as the "app_id" field in the response to the
            "Getting Access Credentials" call.
            </p>

            <p>
                The current App ID being used in this session is: <span class="app-id"></span><br/>
                To switch app please choose another app from the Applications tab above then navigate back here.
            </p>

            <!--input id="appId" type="text" name="appId" placeholder="App ID"-->

            <pre><code class="query-display language-graphql">mutation sendItem($identityId: Int!, $recipientIdentityId: Int!, $tokenId: String!, $value: Int!) {

                Pressing the 'Submit Query' button will POST the query above to the Cloud Platform endpoint, along with additional parameters encoded
                as follows:

                In this example query, we have created an Item transfer request for the sender to either accept or deny using their Enjin Wallet. This
                has a myriad of uses in gameplay, such as letting a game server reward a player with some Item based on their in-game actions. The
                corresponding function in the Unity SDK to this GraphQL call is <a
                    href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#a1dd110b494d572b3b7eccb671585dbb2" target="_blank">SendCryptoItemRequest(int
                identityID, string tokenID, int recipientID, int value, System.Action&lt;RequestEvent&gt; callback)</a> which will create an identical
                request for Item transfer as well as registering a callback for listening to successful transfer. This callback can be used in similar
                fashion to the "Linking a Wallet" example.
