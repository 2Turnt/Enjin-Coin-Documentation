			This method, given an access token, will send a request to the Cloud Platform which creates a new trade request to be either accepted or
			denied in the Enjin Wallet of the access token's owner. This second factor of accepting or denying the transfer request on a separate
			service is a security feature to protect against potentially malicious developers, server proxies, or compromised machines.

				Creating a trade request on the Cloud Platform requires specifying an identifier for the sender's Identity, an identifier for the
				second party's Identity, the identifier for the Item being offered, an amount of the Item being offered, the identifier for the Item
				being asked for, and the amount of the Item being asked for. Once the request appears in the sender's wallet and is accepted, the
				second party must issue and accept a request to complete the trade. At this time, the Items are moved from the Ethereum addresses that
				are linked to their respective Identities and into each other's wallets. To do this successfully, the parties require some Ether to
				cover gas costs. They might also potentially require some Enjin Coin to cover transaction fees specified by the game developer. The
				GraphQL query to do so is as follows (note that this is just a sample query transferring a single type of Item; multiple Items can be
				transferred at once by extending what is inserted into the "asking_tokens" and "offering_tokens" arrays):

			<p>
				Some calls to the Cloud Platform require specifying a particular App to operate on. This is one such call. The App is specified by
				setting a header called:
			<pre>X-App-Id</pre>
			With the value being the App ID you which to use. You can find potential App identifiers as the "app_id" field in the response to the
			"Getting Access Credentials" call.
			</p>

			<p>
				The current App ID being used in this session is: <span class="app-id"></span><br/>
				To switch app please choose another app from the Applications tab above then navigate back here.

				In this example query, we have created a trade request for the sender to either accept or deny using their Enjin Wallet. This has a
				myriad of uses in gameplay, such as letting a game server safely handle atomic swaps of Items. The corresponding function in the Unity
				SDK to this GraphQL call is <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#a10d26b82146e1650ae485325f936632a" target="_blank">Enjin.CreateTradeRequest(int
				senderIdentityID, CryptoItem[] itemsFromSender, int[] amountsFromSender, int secondPartyIdentityID, CryptoItem[] itemsFromSecondParty,
				int[] amountsFromSecondParty)</a> which will create an identical request for Item trading as well as registering a callback for
				listening to the first party accepting. This callback can be used in similar fashion to the "Linking a Wallet" example. The second
				party needs to accept this trade request using the "trade_id" value specified here as <a
